=============

Vessel A/B Center allows you and your product managers to run deep-layered A/B experiments on their mobile apps. Through this youâ€™re able to make informed decisions with zero downtime. You can test everything from design and messaging to sign up options, monitor the stats while the test runs and then roll out the winning variations to the entire user base - without any app store releases.
